## We need you!

Help us develop and maintain Styleguidist:

- Answer questions in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/issues) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-styleguidist).
- Review [pull requests](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/pulls).
- Fix bugs and add new features.
- Write articles and talk about Styleguidist on conferences and meetups (weâ€™re always happy to review your texts and slides).

## Commit message conventions

[Commit message conventions](https://github.com/tamiadev/semantic-release-tamia/blob/master/Convention.md) are based on Angular conventions.

## Pull requests

Maintainers merge pull requests by squashing all commits and editing the commit message if necessary.

Use an [appropriate commit type](https://github.com/tamiadev/semantic-release-tamia/blob/master/Convention.md#types). Be especially careful with [breaking changes](https://github.com/tamiadev/semantic-release-tamia/blob/master/Convention.md#breaking-changes).

## Releases

Weâ€™re doing [semi-automated releases](http://blog.sapegin.me/all/semantic-release) with semantic-release.

### Patch releases

Patch releases are fully automated â€” any commit of a `Fix` type is published as a patch release as soon as CI passes.

### Minor and major releases

Weâ€™re using [milestones](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/milestones) to group approved pull requests that should be released together. Minor and major releases require a changelog (see below). Any commit of a `Feat`Â type will not trigger a release until you commit a changelog. Semantic-release will publish a major release if there are any commits with [breaking changes](https://github.com/tamiadev/semantic-release-tamia/blob/master/Convention.md#breaking-changes).

1.  Merge all pull request from a milestone
2.  Resolve possible merge conflicts.
3.  Manually check that Styleguidist still works.
4.  Prepare and commit a changelog.
5.  Wait until semantic-release publishes the release.
6.  Tweet the release!

## Changelogs

### What is a good changelog

- Changelogs are written for users, not developers.
- Changelog should show new features with code examples or GIFs.
- Changelog should make all breaking changes clear.
- Changelog should explain how to migrate to a new version if there are breaking changes.
- Commit log **is not** a changelog.

Hereâ€™s a [good example of a changelog](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/releases/tag/v7.1.0). Check out [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) for more details on good changelogs.

### What should be in a changelog

- Information about pull request authors:<br> `(#1040 by @rafaesc)`
- Open Collective link at the very top:<br> `ðŸ‘‹ **[Support Styleguidist](https://opencollective.com/styleguidist) on Open Collective** ðŸ‘‹`

### Preparing a changelog

1.  Generate a changelog draft using [tamia-changelog](https://github.com/tamiadev/tamia-changelog): `npx tamia-changelog`
2.  Edit `Changelog.md` file.
3.  Commit the changelog: `npx tamia-changelog commit`.
