# Locating your components and organizing your style guide

## Components

By default Styleguidist will search components using this [glob pattern](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer): `src/components/**/*.jsx?`. It will pick up paths like `src/components/Button.js`, `src/components/Button/Button.js` or `src/components/Button/index.js`. It will also ignore test files (`__tests__` folder and file names containing `.test.js`, `.test.jsx`, `.spec.js` and `.spec.jsx`). If it doesn’t work for you, create a `styleguide.config.js` file in your project’s root folder and configure the patterns to fit your project structure.

For example, if your components look like `components/Button/Button.js` + `components/Button/index.js` (meaning you need to skip `index.js`, otherwise the component will be loaded twice):

```javascript
module.exports = {
  components: 'src/components/**/[A-Z]*.js'
};
```

> **Note:** All paths are relative to config folder.

> **Note:** Use [ignore](Configuration.md#ignore) option to exclude some files from the style guide.

## Sections

Group components into sections or add extra Markdown documents to your style guide.

Each section consists of (all fields are optional):

- `name` — section title.
- `content` — location of a Markdown file containing the overview content.
- `components` — a glob pattern string or a function returning a list of components. The same rules apply as for the root `components` option.
- `sections` — array of subsections (can be nested).

Configuring a style guide with textual documentation section and a list of components would look like:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  sections: [
    {
      name: 'Introduction',
      content: 'docs/introduction.md'
    },
    {
      name: 'Documentation',
      sections: [
        {
          name: 'Installation',
          content: 'docs/installation.md'
        },
        {
          name: 'Configuration',
          content: 'docs/configuration.md'
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: 'UI Components',
      content: 'docs/ui.md',
      components: 'lib/components/ui/*.js'
    }
  ]
};
```

## Limitations

React Styleguidist is built on top of [react-docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen). It supports components defined via `React.createClass`, ES2015 class definitions and functions (stateless components), with optional FlowType annotations. If your components do not conform to these syntaxes, then they might not be correctly parsed by react-docgen and not be presented correctly by React Styleguidist.

React-docgen works by parsing the source code of your components. The difference between *parsing* and *executing* source code is important: react-docgen reads your components as static text files and looks for patterns in them like comment blocks, method declarations and so on. It does not run any Javascript code. So if your component is dynamically generated, is wrapped in a higher-order component, or is split into several files, then it might not be parsable by react-docgen. Please see our [examples](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/tree/master/examples) and refer to [react-docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen) documentation for more information about what types of syntax are supported.
